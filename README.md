# Okno's ⚫Files

These are my dotfiles I regularly update and tweak them.
If you wan't to use them, feel free to fork, also you might need to adapt them.

## Installation

To manage symlinks I use [toml-bombadil](https://github.com/oknozor/toml-bombadil), take a look :).
 
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/oknozor/dotfiles.git
bombadil install dotfiles
bombadil link -p ayu-dark laptop|desktop niri
```
